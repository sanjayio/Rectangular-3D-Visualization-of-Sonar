# Rectangular-3D-Visualization-of-Sonar

That was an awesome summer. I interned at the Defense Research and Development Organization, Ministry of Defense, Govt. of India, NPOL, Kochi. The project given to me was amazing. I was given actual sonar data in the form of arrays. What they wanted was a 3D model that traced the movement of the target object. I used OpenGL to do the 3D Visualization and used Qt to integrate the 3D graph into the application. Finally, my application could plot the movement of the target object in a 3D Plane. And the target object could be easily identified from the ocean noise by following the red peak ( maximum intensity ).
